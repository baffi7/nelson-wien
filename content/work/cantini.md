heading: Can-Tini
text: "Knowing we wanted to pursue a retro-futuristic direction, we started our research phase by doing a deep dive into late 60s and early 70s Italian magazine archives. We emerged full of valuable insights into the design language of the era and the casual-cool attitude of vintage drinking culture. Using our findings, we created a custom script logo that embodies Can-tini’s playful sophistication and developed a color palette, typographic system, and layout style that, while inspired by the era, was altogether modern and distinct. The logo became the focal point on the cans and boxes, while a repeating pattern added a whimsical touch, complementing the brand’s retro aesthetic."
